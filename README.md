# Project Title

Challenge #2 - Word Count challenge

## Description

Prompt: Did you know you can access a word count feature on Google Docs by pressing Control + Shift
+ C? We want you to re-implement word count, with a twist. Given a piece of text, return the following
statistics:
1. Character Count
2. Word Count
3. Sentence Count
4. Paragraph Count
5. Bigrams (counts of unique pairs of words)

creative, well-presented solutions.
